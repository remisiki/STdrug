Description: Drug repurposing is a cost-effective strategy for accelerating therapeutic discovery, yet existing single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq)-based methods often overlook the spatial context critical for capturing tissue-specific drug responses. We introduce STADS (Spatial Transcriptomics to Aid Drug-reposition Strategy), a personalized computational framework that leverages spatial transcriptomics data to improve drug repurposing.
